**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my previous work, I would make several adjustments to include ethics and equity considerations. One key adjustment would be ensuring data privacy and security, as mentioned in the slides about patient records and HIPAA protection. For example, while working with sensitive data, I would implement strict access controls and logging to prevent unauthorized access, as was done in the healthcare example where analysts refrained from accessing their colleague’s medical records without consent.

In terms of equity, I would also focus on inclusive database design to avoid issues like bias and exclusion. For instance, ensuring that database fields are designed to accept a wide range of names and formats, so that no one is discriminated against because their name doesn’t fit the system. This is critical in preventing further marginalization, as discussed in the slide on the Pakistani Computerized National ID Card, where design choices can reinforce stereotypes or exclude people.

Lastly, I would be mindful of how databases are structured to ensure fairness. For example, when normalizing tables in database design, as shown in the slides, it’s important to consider how biases might be introduced if certain groups or data points are left out or underrepresented. Taking these steps ensures that both ethics and equity are built into my work.
